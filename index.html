                      <h2 style="color:red;">What is depression?</h2>
                      <p>Depression is classified as a mood disorder. It may be described as feelings of sadness, loss, or anger that interfere with a person’s everyday activities. It’s also fairly common. Though depression and grief share some features, depression is different from grief felt after losing a loved one or sadness felt after a traumatic life event. Depression usually involves self-loathing or a loss of self-esteem, while grief typically does not. In grief, positive emotions and happy memories of the deceased typically accompany feelings of emotional pain. In major depressive disorder, the feelings of sadness are constant.  People experience depression in different ways. It may interfere with your daily work, resulting in lost time and lower productivity. It can also influence relationships and some chronic health conditions. </p>

        <h2 style="color:red;">Solutions For Depression</h2>
        <p>Here are the 5 most common solutions for depression:</p>
        <h3>1. Medication:</h3>
        <p>The most common treatment for depression is the use of antidepressants. These drugs work by balancing chemicals in your brain called neurotransmitters that affect mood and emotions. There are several categories of antidepressants.</p>
         <h3>2. Therapy:</h3>
        <p>Therapy can be a very effective treatment for depression. Most therapists require you meet with them in person on a regular basis or over the Internet via telecommunication. Weekly sessions can help you deal with stressful situations, address your negative beliefs, cope with challenges, and increase your self-esteem—all of which help in treating depression.</p>
        <h3>3. Lifestyle Changes:</h3>
        <p>In addition to medication and therapy changing some of your negative behaviors and habits can help with treating depression.  Some of these changes would be: </p>
        <h4>Get a Routine: </h4>
        <p>When you’re depressed your days become similar in their lack of enjoyment and hard to distinguish from one another. Setting a daily schedule can help you get active and become involved with your life. </p>
        <h4>Set Goals:</h4>
        <p>A major symptom of depression is the sense you can't accomplish anything and because of that you feel bad about yourself. Setting small daily goals such as making the bed, taking a shower, or going for a walk can help. By completing small contrary acts you’ll feel better about your abilities and in turn feel better about yourself. </p>
        <h4>Eat Healthy:</h4>
        <p>When you’re depressed the last thing you probably want to do is eat healthy. Regrettably eating overly processed foods like fast foods and sugary sweets may be adding to your depression. Eating healthy foods has been shown to reverse these issues. What you eat directly affects your brain and your mood.</p>
        <h4>Avoid Drugs and Alcohol: </h4>
        <p>People who suffer from depression desperately want to alter the way they feel. Many turn to drugs and alcohol as a solution. Unfortunately alcohol, tranquilizers, and opiates act as depressant to your nervous system and make your symptoms worse. </p>
        <h4>Exercise:</h4>
        <p>Regular exercise boosts the naturally produced endorphins that your body uses to help you feel better and less depressed.</p>
        <h4>Sleep:</h4>
        <p>It’s recommended you get 6 to 8 hours of sleep a night. But depression can make it hard to sleep, and with too little sleep your depression can get worse. This is where setting a routine can help.</p>

        <h3>4. Meditation</h3>
        <p>Stress and anxiety are major triggers for depression, and meditation has been proven to alter your reaction to those feelings. When you’re stressed the body produces a hormone called cortisol, and meditation lowers cortisol. During meditation your brain is also producing theta waves that usually only occur when you’re asleep, and alpha waves like when you’re daydreaming. When your body gets as relaxed as when it’s sleeping or daydreaming it starts producing dopamine; a neurotransmitter that’s released into your body during pleasurable situations. If you add all those together meditation is probably the best natural treatment for reducing depression.

</p>
        <h3>5. Challenging Negative Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>A lot of the work in treating depression is changing how you think. When you're depressed, you embrace worst-case scenarios and obsessively dwell on the negative. Challenging these negative thoughts is a common treatment for depression.</p>
